# üîê Azure IAM Portal Project

A security and access control project built entirely through the Microsoft Azure graphical portal ‚Äî no CLI, no SDKs, no installations.

This repository demonstrates how to implement Identity and Access Management (IAM) using free-tier Azure resources, focusing on usability, governance, and cost-efficiency.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Create a free-tier Storage Account
- Configure Azure Active Directory (AAD) groups and users
- Assign RBAC roles to control access
- Simulate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Explore Conditional Access policies
- Document limitations and licensing requirements

---

## üß™ Steps Completed

1. Resource Group: `RG-IAM-Project`
2. Storage Account: `iamstoragedemo` (Standard, LRS)
3. Azure AD Groups: `IAM-Admins`, `IAM-Devs`
4. Azure AD Users: `admin01`, `dev01`
5. RBAC Roles: Contributor for Admins, Reader for Devs
6. MFA: Simulated via portal interface (requires Entra ID P1)
7. Conditional Access: Simulated setup (requires Entra ID P1/P2)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations and Licensing Notes

This project was built using free-tier Azure services. Some enterprise-grade features such as **MFA enforcement** and **Conditional Access policies** require a **Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license**, which is not included in the free tier.

To maintain accessibility:

- RBAC was fully implemented using built-in roles and AD groups
- MFA and Conditional Access were simulated via interface walkthroughs
- Screenshots highlight where premium features would be configured

This approach ensures the project remains relevant for learning and demonstration purposes, even without paid licenses.

## üß† Key Learnings

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Azure
- Identity governance with Azure Active Directory
- Security best practices using graphical tools
- Cost-efficient cloud architecture for IAM
